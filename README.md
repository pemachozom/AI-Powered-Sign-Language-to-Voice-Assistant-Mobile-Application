# 🤟 Gesture to Voice Mobile Application

An AI-powered mobile application that converts **sign language gestures** into **spoken audio** and **text**, designed to help non-verbal individuals communicate more easily with caregivers and the general public. This project supports inclusivity and accessibility by bridging the communication gap using deep learning and computer vision.

The repository  
👉 [AI-Powered Sign Language to Voice Assistant Integration](https://github.com/pemachozom/AI-Powered-Sign-Language-to-Voice-Assistant-Integration)  
focuses specifically on the **integration of trained deep learning models** into the mobile application. It includes:

- API endpoints for gesture recognition  
- Preprocessing pipelines for mobile input  
- Integration logic between the Flutter app and Flask backend  

This complements the main mobile interface by enabling real-time AI-driven gesture-to-voice translation on the app.
